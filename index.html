            <p>Hey! I’m Jason Matthews. When I’m not out on the football pitch or at the gym, you’ll usually find me staying active and enjoying sports. Football (soccer) has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. It’s not just about the game, it’s about winning, bragging rights and having a good time. I’m also a huge fan of Manchester City FC, and following their games always keeps me happy. Recently, I watched the Reggae Boys take on Trinidad & Tobago at the National Stadium, and it was a surreal experience feeling the energy of the crowd and cheer them on in person especially seeing that we won the game. Staying active through exercise helps me stay energized, clear my head, and balance everything else I do in life.</p>

            <p>When I’m indoors, I love diving into the world of gaming. Video games are my way to unwind, challenge myself, and connect with friends online. Some of my favorite games include God of War, Spider-Man, Fortnite and Call of Duty. I especially enjoy playing with friends for hours on end, whether we’re exploring epic adventures, swinging through the city, battling in online matches, or taking on challenging missions. Gaming keeps me sharp, sparks my creativity, and is a fun way to spend time with friends. Between football, exercise, and gaming, I feel like I’ve found a mix that keeps life exciting, fun, and full of new challenges.</p>
